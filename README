What:
This is an instrument file for using MongoDB as your primary datastore of your Orchestra Apps.
This adds a full REST mapper for modeling your mongo objects in Orchestra.

Installation:
First you must have already installed the sys_orchestra (https://github.com/christopherhein/system-orchestra-mvc)
If that is installed use:

  $ instrument pull mongo-database
  
This with build the instrument locally in /usr/local/orchestra/instruments/ once that is complete you can use:

  $ instrument install mongo-database
  
from the root directory of any Orchestra App and it will install all the necessary files, plus walk you through any additional steps.

Enjoy!
